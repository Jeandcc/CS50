```
$ ./readability
Text: Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. For another, he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of the night. And he also happened to be a wizard.

```
$ ./speller texts/lalaland.txt
MISSPELLED WORDS

[...]
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT
[...]
Shangri
[...]
fianc
[...]
Sebastian's
[...]
```

## PSET 6
Set of exercises focused on getting students started with the programming language Python.
1. [Hello](https://github.com/Jeandcc/CS50/blob/master/pset6/Hello/hello.py): Recreation of a previously performed exercise when using C as the language. 
2. [Mario](https://github.com/Jeandcc/CS50/blob/master/pset6/Mario/mario.py): Recreation of a previously performed exercise when using C as the language. 
3. [Credit](https://github.com/Jeandcc/CS50/blob/master/pset6/Credit/credit.py): Recreation of a previously performed exercise when using C as the language. 
4. [Readability](https://github.com/Jeandcc/CS50/blob/master/pset6/Redability/readability.py): Recreation of a previously performed exercise when using C as the language.
